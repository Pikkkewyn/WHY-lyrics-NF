        [Intro]
        Too many faces, too many faces, too many faces

        [Verse]
        Yeah, what's your definition of success? (Ayy)
        I don't trust the thoughts that come inside my head (Woo)
        I don't trust this thing that beats inside my chest
        Who I am and who I wanna be cannot connect; why?
        Don't think I deserve it? You get no respect (Woo)
        I just made a couple mil', still not impressed
        "Let You Down" goes triple platinum, yeah, okay, okay, I guess (Ayy)
        Smile for a moment then these questions startin' to fill my head, not again!
        I push away the people that I love the most; why? (Woo)
        I don't want no one to know I'm vulnerable; why? (Woo)
        That makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable; why? (Ayy)
        Stop askin' me questions, I just wanna feel alive
        Until I die—this isn't Nate's flow (Woo)
        Just let me rhyme; I'm in disguise
        I'm a busy person, got no time for lies; one of a kind
        They don't see it; I pull out they eyes; I'm on the rise!
        I've been doin' this for most my life with no advice (Woo)
        Take my chances, I just roll the dice, do what I like
        As a kid, I was afraid of heights, put that aside
        Now I'm here and they look so surprised, well so am I, woo
        They don't invite me to the parties, but I still arrive
        Kick down the door and then I go inside
        Give off that "I do not belong here" vibe
        Then take the keys right off the counter, let's go for a ride
        Why do y'all look mortified? (Ayy)
        I keep to myself, they think I'm sorta shy, organized
        "Let You Down's" the only song you've heard of? Well then you're behind (Woo)
        Story time; wish that I could think like Big Sean does, but I just can't decide (aah!)
        If I should stick my knife inside of Pennywise
        I, I don't care what anybody else thinks—lies (Haha)
        I do not need nobody to help me—lies
        I kinda feel guilty 'cause I'm wealthy; why?
        I don't understand, it's got me questionin' like
        "Why? Just tell me why"—not back to this flow
        Inside I feel divided
        Back when I ain't had a dime, but had the drive
        Back before I ever signed, I questioned life, like, "Who am I, man?" Woo
        Nothin' to me's ever good enough
        I could be workin' for 24 hours a day and think I never did enough
        My life is a movie, but there ain't no tellin' what you're gonna see in my cinema (No)
        I wanna be great, but I get in the way of myself and I think about everything that I could never be
        Why do I do it though? Ayy, yeah
        Why you always lookin' aggravated?
        Not a choice, you know I had to make it
        When they talk about the greatest, they gon' probably never put us in the conversation
        Like somethin', then I gotta take it
        Write somethin', then I might erase it
        I love it, then I really hate it
        What's the problem, Nathan? I don't know!
        I know I like to preach to always be yourself (Yeah)
        But my emotions make me feel like I am someone else
        Me and pride had made a pact that we don't need no help
        Which feels like I'm at war inside myself, but I forgot the shells
        I hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
        A lot of people know me, but not a lot know me well
        Hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
        A lot of people know me, but they don't know me well

        [Outro]
        Too many faces, too many faces, too many faces

                    On “WHY,” NF talks about the recent success on his hit single “Let You Down,” being an 
                    outcast, his aggression and wrestles with inner conflict. Following “NO NAME,” this is the second single 
                    NF has released in 2018.

                    Just like “NO NAME,” this track was teased on Twitter the day of the release with two tweets, 
                    one stating “W” and the other stating “H,” however he promptly deleted the tweets.
                    
                    The music video was released along with the track and became No. 1 on Youtube’s “Trending” page. 
                    It features NF in a run-down building with spray paint over the wall, very similar to the music 
                    video of “Intro 2.” He also wears black paint on his face just like in the music video for “Outcast.”
                    
                    The song was later announced as part of NF's fourth studio album, The Search, and stands as 
                    the first single released from the project.
